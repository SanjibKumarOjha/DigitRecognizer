Handwritten Digit Recognizer Project

This project builds a machine learning model that recognizes handwritten digits (0–9) using the MNIST dataset.

Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook (Google Colab)
- TensorFlow / Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- OpenCV (for drawing and image handling)

How to Run
1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Open `notebook.ipynb` in **Jupyter Notebook** or **Google Colab**.
3. Run the notebook step-by-step to:
   - Load data
   - Train the model
   - Test predictions
   - Upload your own handwritten digit image and predict!

How to Predict Your Own Digit
- Prepare a simple image of a digit (0–9) on a white background.
- Upload the image when asked in the notebook.
- The model will process it and predict the digit.
- Use google colab for better results

Future Improvements
- Build a web application for real-time digit drawing.
- Extend the model to recognize handwritten letters (using EMNIST dataset).
